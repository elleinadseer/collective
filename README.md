## Description

We have created a tech forum for the modern era by combining elements of feed-based social medias with technology forums.
The main feed utilises forum board-adjacent tags as a filter for a single content stream with each post limited to a character limit that randomises on each day. This character limit was a product of our core focus on incentivising creativity. 

Technologies featured in this project are as listed: Node.js, MySQL, Express, sequelize, handlebars, Day.js, icon functionality from FontAwesome, user sessions and bcrypt.

## Development

We are proud of the outcome of this group project. Halfway through the project we hit a slow point, the amount of code we had to implement for a group project of this size was overwhelming but we doubled down and met on multiple occasions outside of study sessions in order to push through the size of our codebase. Our wireframe from the outset of project was detailed enough that we kept to this design and did not deviate from it, simplifying the coding process.
